    <h1>Morse Code Conversion Program</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Morse code is a system of communication that uses dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. A dot is a short signal, and a dash is a long signal. The spaces between signals represent the separation between letters, words, and sentences.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A text editor to write the C program. Any text editor will do, but a dedicated C editor like Code:Blocks or Visual Studio Code will make your life easier.</li>
        <li>A C compiler to convert the C program into machine code that can be executed by the computer. There are many different C compilers available, but GCC is a popular and free option.</li>
        <li>A linker to combine the object files generated by the compiler into an executable file. The linker also resolves any dependencies between the object files.</li>
        <li>A runtime environment to provide the necessary resources for the C program to execute. The runtime environment typically includes a library of functions that the C program can call.</li>
    </ul>
