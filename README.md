Morse code is a system of communication that uses dots and dashes to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.
A dot is a short signal, and a dash is a long signal.
The spaces between signals represent the separation between letters, words, and sentences.
This repository contains a Morse code conversion program written in c language.

**The prerequisites to run a simple C program are:**

•	A text editor to write the C program. Any text editor will do, but a dedicated C editor like Code:Blocks or Visual Studio Code will make your life easier.
•	A C compiler to convert the C program into machine code that can be executed by the computer. There are many different C compilers available, but GCC is a popular and free option.
•	A linker to combine the object files generated by the compiler into an executable file. The linker also resolves any dependencies between the object files.
•	A runtime environment to provide the necessary resources for the C program to execute. The runtime environment typically includes a library of functions that the C program can call.



The File project.c contains program which can convert text to Morse code and Morse code to text.
The Morse Code mind map.png contains a visual representation of the program's features and functionality.
The flowchart of morse code convertor is a diagram that illustrates the steps involved in the program's execution.
The functional requirement of Morse code document specifies the features of morse code convertor. 


Hope you find this code useful :) Happy Coding
